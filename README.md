# Agendenator

A one-stop-shop for the Atlanta Department of City Planning's Neighborhood Planning Units team. 

## Description

Resources and Support staff can easily find reference info for the 25-unit NPU system, such as leadership contact info, assigned planners, and Zoom Meeting info.
Assigned planners can access the online Planners Voting Report builder, which now has access to the agenda items and can automagicall populate item info for voting and review-and-comment items. 

### Future Work

Looking to implement a document export function so that NPU Agendas can be procedurally generated and then exported for final adjustments and printing.
This enhancement should also simplify the process of exporting Planners Voting Reports for Chair signature.
Direct submission of Voting Report disposition is theoretically possible!

..And probably more!!
